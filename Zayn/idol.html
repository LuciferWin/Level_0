                Zayn Malik was born Zain Javadd Malik on 12 January 1993 in Bradford, West Yorkshire, England to an immigrant Pakistani Muslim father, Yaser Malik, and a White British mother of English and Irish descent, Trisha Malik (née Brannan), who converted to Islam upon her marriage. Malik has one older sister, Doniya, and two younger sisters, Waliyha and Safaa. He had an Islamic upbringing, though he no longer identifies as a Muslim.
                Malik grew up in East Bowling, Bradford, in a working-class family and neighbourhood. He attended Lower Fields Primary School and Tong High School (now Tong Leadership Academy) in Bradford. As a teenager he took performing arts courses and appeared in school productions. He grew up listening to his father's urban music records, primarily R&B, hip hop, and reggae. He wrote raps when he was at school, and sang on stage for the first time when singer Jay Sean visited his school. Malik also boxed for two years, from the age of 15 to 17. Before beginning his music career, he had planned to pursue an academic degree in English in the hope of becoming an English teacher.

                Malik was raised as a Muslim and speaks English and Urdu, and can read Arabic. In the past, he has been a target of anti-Muslim attacks. In 2017, Malik said he identified as a non-practising Muslim and did not want to be defined by his religion or cultural background." He told British Vogue in November 2018 that he no longer considered himself a Muslim. Malik is a lifelong supporter of Bradford City A.F.C.
                Malik started dating fellow X Factor contestant Geneva Lane of Belle Amie in 2010 until 2011. Malik then dated another X Factor contestant Rebecca Ferguson for a few months until July 2011. He subsequently dated actress Stephanie Davis in the same year. Malik began dating English singer Perrie Edwards of the band Little Mix in December 2011. They got engaged in August 2013, before breaking up in August 2015.
                Malik began dating American model Gigi Hadid in late 2015, although they had broken up and reconciled multiple times. Hadid starred in his music video for the song "Pillowtalk". The two appeared together on the August 2017 cover of Vogue. In 2017, Hadid photographed them both for a Versace ad campaign. Malik and Hadid welcomed their first child, a daughter, in September 2020.
                Malik and Hadid ended their relationship after Hadid's mother accused Malik of striking her in October 2021. Malik entered a no contest plea to four charges of harassment against Hadid's mother Yolanda. Court papers stated that Malik "grabbed and shoved her into a dresser causing mental anguish and physical pain" and said "lewd, lascivious, threatening or obscene words." He was sentenced by a Pennsylvania court to 360 days of probation, and to complete anger management and domestic violence education programmes.
                The family spent a majority of their time in their home on a farm in rural Bucks County, Pennsylvania, where Hadid's mother and sister also own land. A working farm, Malik tended to horses and cows. Malik also owns an apartment in SoHo, Manhattan. He previously owned homes in Los Angeles and London, but sold them both in 2018.
                Malik has openly spoke about suffering from an eating disorder while in One Direction, contributing it to the workload and pace of life while touring. He has also spoken about suffering from anxiety, specifically around live solo performances, having cancelled multiple scheduled concerts due to "the worst anxiety" of his career and lack of confidence.
